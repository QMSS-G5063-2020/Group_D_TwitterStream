# TwitterNetworkStreaming
#### By Ceci Cabello, Lemon Lin, and Gabriel Gilling

#### Our Project:
A website/user-interface for generating real-time streaming insights from twitter data that matches the user-input regex. When providing a hashtag and the number of seconds the app "listens" to the tweets containing the hashtag for the amount of seconds selected by the user. The text of each tweet is then processed and put through a sentiment analysis using NRC dictionaries, the results of said analysis  are displayed using graphs and maps.
